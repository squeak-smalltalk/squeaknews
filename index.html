            <dt>Squeak Documentation Initiative</dt>

            <dd>Squeak Documentation initiative is a Squeak News sponsored activity that will start with this issue. Here we will explain mechanisms and ask for volunteers for this initiative. The goal is to create a giant living reference manual and a reference server that any Squeak that is on the net can hook up to and access to on-line documantaion. This documentation will be in a form that can be embedded in any image and will have built in mechanisms to update itself when changes are made and post these updates to a central server or other peers. Another useful document is a user guide which will also be semi-automatically generated. Documentation swiki pages will be used to capture most additions and modifications to the documentation. More details will soon be available from the Squeak News site.</dd>

Author/instigator/editor of the two current Squeak books, hacker of PWS &amp; the original Swiki, hoster of Swikis, teacher of Squeak... He, his students, and his classes are always throwing out cool stuff for the rest of us. For his class on "Computer Music Implementation", he wrote a series of active essays, which cover everything from the built in Squeak sound tools to MIDI. Aside from being nicely written/constructed on interesting topics -- i.e., an enjoyable read -- they are great examples of active essays. Mark was kind enough to let us feature the entire series in Squeak News with a bonus introduction that puts these great active essays in perspective.</dd>
